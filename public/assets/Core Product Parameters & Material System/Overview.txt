Overview

Polymer Solid Electrolyte
A proprietary iCOFs/PIL composite electrolyte featuring high ionic conductivity and wide electrochemical stability window.
→ Non-flammable, process-compatible, and validated for high-voltage cathodes.

Composite LFP Cathode
Engineered to balance high safety, low cost, and compatibility with solid-state interfaces.
→ Optimized for polymer-based SSB integration.

Lithium Metal Anode
Enables high energy density and low interfacial resistance.
→ Demonstrates stable cycling with suppressed dendrite growth.
